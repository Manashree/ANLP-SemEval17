- STS.input.answers-students.txt: The source of these pairs is the BEETLE corpus (Dzikovska et al., 2010), is a question-answer data set collected and annotated during the evaluation of the BEETLE II  tutorial dialogue system. The BEETLE II system is an intelligent tutoring engine that teaches students in basic electricity and  electronics. The corpus was used in the student response analysis  task of semeval-2013. Given a question, a known correct "reference  answer" and the "student answer", the goal of the task was to assess  student answers as correct, contradictory or incorrect (partially  correct, irrelevant or not in the domain). For STS,we selected pairs of answers made up by single sentences.

- STS.input.answers-forum.txt: This data set consists of paired  answers collected from the Stack Exchange question and answer  websites (http://stackexchange.com/). Some of the paired answers are in response to the same question, while others are in response to different questions. Each answer in the pair consists of a statement composed of a single sentence or sentence fragment. For multi-sentence answers, we extract the single sentence from the larger answer that appears to best summarize the answer. The Stack  Exchange data license requires that we provide additional metadata  that allows participants to recover the source of each paired  answer. Systems submitted to the shared task must not make use of  this meta-data in anyway to assign STS scores or to otherwise inform the operation of the system.
